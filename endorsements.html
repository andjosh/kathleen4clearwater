                I strongly support Kathleen for her dedication and persistent efforts to personally connect with Clearwater residents and gain an understanding of issues in our neighborhoods. Her public comments made at Environmental Advisory Board meetings clearly express a commitment to the protection of the City's natural resources and a progressive approach to the pursuit of sustainable principles for the environment. As a career educator her ability to listen and give thoughtful consideration to complex matters before espousing an opinion is refreshing. Kathleen will be a voice on the City Council that represents the interests of the residents.

                Kathleen is the kind of hard worker that our City desperately needs.  Since she decided to run for City Council, she has taken so much time and energy to go out into the neighborhoods to understand what residents truly need, instead of focusing on political issues.  Kathleen has my vote because she stands for sustainability in life and business, and will fight for affordable housing in our community.

                Kathleen cares about small businesses.  She is particularly interested in bringing more diversity in both business ownership and in types of businesses, and in reducing the challenges of starting a new business.  She has also been supportive of me and my efforts to educate and empower young adults here in Clearwater.

                I have known Kathleen for nearly three years.  She approached me about joining our Panther Pal reading program in the spring of 2017 after having just learned about it.  And although we only had a few months left of the school year, she didn't want to wait until the following fall to become engaged with helping our struggling readers.  Kathleen is a dedicated volunteer who uses her professional talents to engage with our diverse student population and improve students' reading scores. She has also shown great leadership skills in forming a swim team for the local YMCA.
