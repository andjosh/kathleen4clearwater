            Hi! Thanks so much for visiting my page. Here’s a little bit about me…
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Michigan, where my family was and is committed to public service. I raised my family in Northern Illinois where I was fortunate to be both a stay-at-home mom and then return to the workforce as an educator. I’ve spent my life working with people individually to improve their quality of life and empower them through education. I am a committed “hands on” leader and am ready to work hard for Clearwater residents.  
        </p>

            Dealing with climate change and its impact on Clearwater is critical to residents and businesses.  See the contrast in what Kathleen proposes in contrast to others running for Seat 3.  Kathleen is a leader that takes this seriously.

                        Kathleen Beckman, a retired teacher running to unseat Cundiff in Seat 3, has proposed a detailed climate strategy. She wants the city to set measurable renewable energy goals and carbon emission reduction goals over the next 30 years. She also wants to create a green fund that takes savings from using renewable energy and reinvests the money into future projects. [...] Elias and Cundiff, the climate skeptics, say they are largely happy with the city’s existing environmental efforts.

                        To mitigate the impacts of climate change and storm events, Clearwater needs a comprehensive environmental strategy, measurable goals, and action. By the end of 2020, the city should set environmental and resiliency goals and take action that will benefit residents across many areas.
