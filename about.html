            Hi! Thanks so much for visiting my page. Here’s a little bit about me…
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Michigan, where my family was and is committed to public service. I raised my family in Northern Illinois where I was fortunate to be both a stay-at-home mom and then return to the workforce as an educator, for over 15 years. I’ve spent my life working with people individually to improve their quality of life and empower them through education. I am a committed “hands on” leader and am ready to work hard for Clearwater residents.  
        </p>

            Over the last few days there has been some negative/partisan propaganda (Robocalls, mailers, emails) put out about me. The latest, a divisive and dishonest Robocall, appears to be an act of desperation.  The Tampa Bay Times reports that this is the work of a Republican PAC.   I wonder why they are so afraid to have a strong advocate for Clearwater residents on the council. 
        </p>
        <p class="">
            Rather than engage in this nonsense, I choose to spend my time canvassing neighborhoods, attending government related meetings and advocating for all residents.

                        Kathleen Beckman, a retired teacher running to unseat Cundiff in Seat 3, has proposed a detailed climate strategy. She wants the city to set measurable renewable energy goals and carbon emission reduction goals over the next 30 years. She also wants to create a green fund that takes savings from using renewable energy and reinvests the money into future projects. [...] Elias and Cundiff, the climate skeptics, say they are largely happy with the city’s existing environmental efforts.
