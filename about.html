            Hi! Thanks so much for visiting my page. Here’s a little bit about me…
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Michigan, where my family was and is committed to public service. I raised my family in Northern Illinois where I was fortunate to be both a stay-at-home mom and then return to the workforce as an educator. I’ve spent my life working with people individually to improve their quality of life and empower them through education. I am a committed “hands on” leader and am ready to work hard for Clearwater residents.
