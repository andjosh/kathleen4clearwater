To protect our environment, Clearwater needs to set environmental goals and take action that will benefit residents across many areas.

I will advocate for the following priorities for Clearwater:

1. Set 100% renewable energy goals and carbon emission goals for city operations and the entire city. These measurable goals should be reached no later than 2050, but preferably much sooner.  Also set interim goals for 2030.
2. Set energy reduction goals of 25-50% over the next 10 years, energy efficiency standards for city buildings.
3. Put in place a revolving green fund that takes savings from renewable energy and efficiencies and reinvests a portion of the savings for future projects.
4. Put in place policies and procedures that ensure transparency and accountability to show progress on a yearly basis.
5. Create policies that enable residents and businesses to make similar investments in renewable energy and energy efficiencies.

With these types of goals and actions, the city can literally save millions of dollars. While at the same time, we improve the health of residents, protect our tourism economy that depends on our environment.
